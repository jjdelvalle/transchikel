# An attempt at an ASR system for Kaqchikel

Kaqhickel is a low resource language with not a lot of presence in general on the internet.
However, this should not stop it from being part of the researched languages in NLP.
Furthermore, it being included in research will likely result in benefits for its speakers.
For these reasons, I will be attempting to include Kaqchikel in my research, and this will only be the beginning of it.

This readme file is to be completed
